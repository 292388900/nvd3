# nvd3 - v0.0.1

A reusable chart library for d3.JS by Bob Monteverde of Novus Partners.


Currently in an early stage of development, but will be a very active project.  It may change quite a bit from its current state, but will always try to follow the style in which d3.js was done.

You can also check out the [examples page](http://novus.github.com/nvd3/)


## **Project is not dead, the creator is just recovering from surgery, after breaking his clavicle.  Will be back soon.
