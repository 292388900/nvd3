[13:23:38] <JFSIII> Hello, Log Bot and others
[13:28:47] <davidsouther> Woot.
[13:28:53] <davidsouther> I should replace it with something smarter
[13:29:21] <davidsouther> hubot, probably

[14:10:33] <southerd> JFSIII: joesepi is typing up some triage guidelines for moving forward with cleaning out the Github backlog
[14:11:05] <southerd> At the same time, I'm typing up some notes on the refactor going on in the (poorly named) "Canvas" branch
[14:11:11] <JFSIII> OK, great
[14:12:31] <JFSIII> I must confess I didn't get around to making notes on the code. This weekend, I spent my free hours moving my work project from grunt to a simple node.js build script
[14:13:04] <JFSIII> but I'm pretty familiar with the code. I've been using it (and reading / patching models) for 9+ months.
[14:21:46] <southerd> Yeah, at this point the "Canvas" refactor is just pulling out the most commonly repeated bits of code
[14:22:10] <southerd> Specifically, margins & inserting the wrap-classed DOM nodes.
[14:24:41] <southerd> With that, we should also have tests for all the charts, and find a way to automate them (rather than start a static server in the root folder and click through `tests/`
[14:25:51] <southerd> I'd also like to see us move away from the getter/setter mechanism - I'd almost go so far as to call it an anti pattern, but it's so integral to the way d3 handles object state that might not be possible
[14:26:31] <southerd> And finally, I want to see a more composite approach to creating complex charts
[16:39:53] <southerd> hey there, novusTyler
[16:40:15] <novusTyler> hi
